# Virtual Dressing Room - Virtual Try-On with AI üëóüì∏

Virtual Dressing Room is an interactive, real-time application that lets users try on different shirts using their webcam. By combining the power of **MediaPipe** for pose detection and **OpenCV** for image processing, this project provides an engaging and fun experience for users who want to see how different shirts look on them without physically trying them on.
